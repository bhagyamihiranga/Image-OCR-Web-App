‘sphere, it makes the upperside appear lighter and the underside darker, grading from one to the
‘other. This pattern of light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect.
‘The classical form of countershading. discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Henderson Thayer.
works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark to
light. n theory this could be useful for military camouflage, butin practice it has rarely been applied,
despite the best efforts of Thayer and, later, in the Second World Wer, ofthe zoologist Hugh Cott.
‘The precise function of various patterns of animal coloration that have been called countershading
hhas been debated by 2oologists such as Hannah Rowland (2008), with the suggestion that there may
’be multiple functions including flattening and background matching when viewed from the side;
background matching when viewed from above or below, implying separate color schemes for the
top and bottom surfaces; outline obliteration from above; and a variety of other largely untested non-
camouflage theories. A related mechanism, counter-illumination, adds the creation of light

by bioluminescence or lamps to match the actual brightness of a background. Counter-illumination
‘camouflage is common in marine organisms such as squid. It has been studied up to

the prototype stage Mimicry(L. mimus, to imitate) occurs when a species resembles one, or
sometimes more than one, other species and gains protection by the resemblance.

in evolutionary biology, mimicry is an evolved resemblance between an organism and another object,
‘often an organism of another species. Mimicry may evolve between diferent species, or between
individuals of the same species. Often, mimicry functions to protect a species from predators, making
itan antipredator adaptation. Mimicry evolves if receiver (such as a predator) perceives the
similarity between a mimic (the organism that has a resemblance) and a model (the organism it
resembles) and as 3 result changes its behavior in a way that provides a selective advantage to the
‘mimic. The resemblances that evolve in mimicry can be visual, acoustic, chemical, tactile, or electric,
‘or combinations of these sensory modalities.

‘Mimicry may be to the advantage of both organisms that share a resemblance, in which case itis @
form of mutualism; or mimicry can be to the detriment of one, making it parasitic or competitive. The

evolutionary convergence between groups is driven by the selective action of a signal-receiver or
